# MachineLearning-Whitebox-Prototype

This is the prototype for a new project under the supervision of the Abu Dhabi startup, WhiteBox HR. 


Goal 1: Use ECLAT algorithm to find associations between assesment scores on past candidate data (personality assessment scores, career drivers, cognitive assessment scores, techncial assessment scores)


Goal 2: Use Linear Regression (Decision Tree) to generate predicted new candidate fintess score (classify as fit or unfit, as well percentage of fitness)
